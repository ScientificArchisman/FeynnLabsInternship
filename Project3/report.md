# Model explanation
---

As for the mathematical expression of the model, extracting an exact mathematical formula from an ensemble model like XGBoost is non-trivial and generally not practical due to its complexity. The model consists of numerous decision trees, each contributing to the final prediction.

However, here's a simplified explanation:

\[ \text{Prediction} = f_1(x) + f_2(x) + \ldots + f_N(x) \]

where \( f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_N \) are the individual decision trees in the ensemble (with \( N \) being the total number of trees), and \( x \) represents the input features.

Each decision tree \( f_i(x) \) outputs a prediction based on the input features \( x \). The final prediction of the XGBoost model is a sum of the predictions from all the trees in the ensemble, possibly weighted.


Certainly, let's delve into a textual description of how the XGBoost model makes predictions.

### XGBoost Model Description

**XGBoost** (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is an ensemble learning method, specifically it is a tree boosting method. The model is comprised of the aggregation of several decision trees. The predictions from all the trees are combined (typically summed) to make a final prediction. 

#### Decision Trees
Each decision tree is a structure that makes decisions based on asking a series of questions. For the XGBoost model, the decision trees are binary trees, meaning each node in the tree splits the data into two branches based on a feature value. The decision of which feature to split on and what value to split at is determined during training, with the objective to separate the data in a way that minimizes the prediction error.

#### Boosting
In the context of the XGBoost model, "boosting" refers to the method used to create the ensemble of trees. Initially, a single tree is trained on the data, and its predictions are used to calculate residuals (differences) between its predictions and the actual target values. The next tree is then trained to predict these residuals, essentially trying to correct the errors made by the first tree. This process is repeated, with each subsequent tree trying to correct the errors made by the ensemble of all previous trees.

#### Mathematical Formulation
Mathematically, the prediction \( \hat{y} \) for a given input sample \( x \) can be expressed as:

\[
\hat{y}(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} f_k(x)
\]

where:
- \( K \) is the total number of trees in the model.
- \( f_k(x) \) is the prediction of the \( k^{th} \) tree.
- \( x \) is the input sample.

Each tree \( f_k \) produces a prediction for a given input sample, and these predictions are summed to produce the final prediction \( \hat{y}(x) \). 

### Example
Imagine we have a model with three trees, and for a given input sample \( x \), the trees make the following predictions:
- Tree 1 predicts 15
- Tree 2 predicts -5
- Tree 3 predicts 10

The final prediction \( \hat{y}(x) \) of the model would be:
\[
\hat{y}(x) = 15 - 5 + 10 = 20
\]

### Additional Notes
- **Non-linear Relationships**: XGBoost can model non-linear relationships because each decision tree is a non-linear model, and the ensemble of trees can represent a sum of non-linear terms.
  
- **Interactions Between Variables**: The model can also represent interactions between variables. In the tree structure, if a split on one feature is followed by a split on another feature, this indicates that the model has found an interaction between the two features.

- **Regularization**: XGBoost also incorporates regularization (penalties for overly complex trees) into the learning process to avoid overfitting.

Creating an explicit expression for an XGBoost model, especially one that is human-readable, is extremely complex due to the ensemble nature of the model and the potential depth and complexity of each decision tree within the ensemble. 

An XGBoost model makes predictions by summing the contributions of all trees in the ensemble. Each tree is a series of binary decisions based on feature values, culminating in a prediction. A single tree might look something like this in a simplified pseudo-code form:

```plaintext
if feature_1 < some_value_1:
    if feature_2 < some_value_2:
        prediction = value_A
    else:
        prediction = value_B
else:
    if feature_3 < some_value_3:
        prediction = value_C
    else:
        prediction = value_D
```

In the XGBoost model we've trained, there are 10 trees (`n_estimators=10`), each of which has a structure similar to the one described above, but likely with more nodes and potentially deeper structures. 

If we attempted to write out a comprehensive mathematical representation of all 10 trees in the trained model, it would be extremely lengthy and complex. Moreover, XGBoost models, especially ones with many estimators and deep trees, are practically impossible to represent with a simple equation or piece of code.

Hereâ€™s a very simplified pseudo-expression for an XGBoost model with two trees:

\[ 
\text{Prediction} = \left( \sum_{\text{paths in Tree 1}} \text{Path Output} \times \text{Path Condition} \right) + \left( \sum_{\text{paths in Tree 2}} \text{Path Output} \times \text{Path Condition} \right) 
\]

Where:
- **Path Output** is the prediction value at the leaf node of a particular path.
- **Path Condition** is a boolean (1 or 0) indicating whether the input sample follows the path.


Let's create a visual representation of one tree in the trained XGBoost model as text. This will give a sense of how the decision making is structured within a single tree, even though it is only one part of the whole model. This text-based visualization will present each split in the tree, the feature, and the threshold used for the split, and finally the output at each leaf. 


The textual representation of the first tree in the XGBoost model looks like this:

### Explanation

- Each row represents a node in the tree, starting with the root node (0). 
- The first part of the row (e.g., `f1<0.751977086`) is the decision rule at that node. For instance, `f1<0.751977086` implies that the decision involves checking if the first feature (f1) is less than 0.751977086.
- The `yes`, `no`, and `missing` entries indicate the child node that will be traversed next, depending on the outcome of the decision rule and whether the feature value is missing.
- When a `leaf` entry is encountered, it indicates that this node is a terminal node and provides the output value if the decision path reaches this point.
